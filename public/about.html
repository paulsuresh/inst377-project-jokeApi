    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>In recent years, depression rates have surged globally, with the World Health Organization reporting that over 280 million people suffer from depression. Many factors contribute to this rise, such as loneliness and anxiety having reached unprecedented levels in today's digital age. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, millions of people, particularly young adults, are grappling with these emotional struggles.</p>

        <p>Many turn to social media as a form of escape, seeking connection or distraction. However, instead of relief, they are often confronted with an overwhelming amount of negative content. Our random joke generator aims to address the worsening mental health of individuals who turn to social media as a refuge, only to be met with content that exacerbates their loneliness and anxiety.</p>

        <p>Laughter has been proven to reduce stress, improve mood, and even foster a sense of community. In a digital landscape filled with anxiety-inducing content, a good joke could be a small but impactful way to alleviate the emotional toll that social media use often takes. By integrating a Joke API into online spaces, we aim to provide moments of lightness and joy that can break the cycle of negativity.</p>
